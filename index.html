    My husband and I moved to US in Dec 2011.Testing job did not interest me much and hence I decided to quit and look for other opportunities.

    I finally decided to be a front end designer  and found a perfect place to learn everything I need to be a front end web designer. Startup Institute is the place I decided to join to learn what I want to do.

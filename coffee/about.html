<p>Coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an evergreen shrub of the genus Coffea. 
The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded Coffea arabica, and the "robusta" form of the hardier 
Coffea canephora. The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), but has a more bitter taste. Coffee 
plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in equatorial Latin America, Southeast Asia, Maldives, and Africa. 
Once ripe, coffee "berries" are picked, processed, and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, 
depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.

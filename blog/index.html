	A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, 
	which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.
	In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a 
	package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.)
	which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.
